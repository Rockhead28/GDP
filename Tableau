Description of process:
Greatly inspired by Hans Rosling. 
1) Downloaded raw data from Gapfinder in a few excel sheets.
2) Created a Python script to combine them into 1 excel sheet containing 40,000+ rows of data. 
3) Run and visualize them on Tableau.
4) Write a script for the video.
5) Took the video at a studio by myself. Learnt how to setup camera, mic, teleprompter, and lighting.
6) Combine various clips into capcut, and then add the graph effects via Adobe After Effects (Free Trial).

Things I learnt:
1) Knowing how to combine various sheets of large data into 1 sheet.
2) Creating a python script on laptop, and knowing how to run it via terminal.
3) Know more functions about Tableau.
4) Background of the video is a very important matter. Should have almost same color backdrop to have an easier time in editing the words/graphs
5) Adobe After Effects, and also Video Editing.
